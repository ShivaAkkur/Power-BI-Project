# Power-BI-Project
1. Done lots of power query transformation like handling null values, data type conversations, trimming the data, split the column, replace function, pivot & unpivot, 
    formatting, adding extra columns to merge two tables and worked on date & time functions.
2. Power pivot is used for data modelling means in which we are creating the relationship between two tables based on unique identity key.
3. I used many DAX functions like time intelligence functions, aggregate functions and date functions.
4. In my project I have used waterfall chart for sum of total revenue on product name by year by year, line charts for MOM growth, clustered column chart for total 
   revenue by sub category wise and I used matrix, tables along with slicer.
